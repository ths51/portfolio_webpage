            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h4>My name is Elijah Wolf and I am a Senior at Timberland High School looking to study Computer Science in college. </h4>

        <h2>Computer Science Explorations</h2>
        <p>Since moving to the St. Louis region in 2017, I have been trying my best to figure out how to live properly and get everything together, and I have been studying computer science and learning since I got truly into computers during just my first year here. I have been spending a lot of studying and learning about computers and the different ways I could use them to create a variety of different things. I love using my creativity to develop things on my own. Rather than finding resources that do things for me, I prefer to either make them myself or find out how to from several internet resources so I can learn to do it myself or improve upon it. After taking a business technology class in freshman year of high school, I unfortunately was stuck at home for a while due to the pandemic that struck near the end of the school year. So I tried to take advantage and took a basic web design class that I would not have been able to take in school normally. I did not learn everything about web design though, and I am now getting back into it with this project here. </p>
        <p>During my junior year, I decided to finally get back into true computer science and took Computer Science A, where I learned some basic Python and other cool parts of computer science that I didn't know before. In this class, I was taught basic methodology that would help me get into the programming mindset and how to strategize as I went through the process of developing different things. I learned Python modules like Pandas, Turtle, and MatPlotLib that would help me figure out how to use Python for different tasks and utilize modules with unique purposes. I explored more on my own at home and was able to, during my junior year, with the help of a couple of classmates, recreate the classic games of Pong and Hangman, which worked almost flawlessly. It was an amazing experience and I have continued to explore this year even though I wasn't able to take another Computer Science class. </p>

        <h2>Playing Ice Hockey</h2>
        <section class="split">
            <p>A couple years before I moved, I began to gain a lot of interest in playing ice hockey, and I'm thankful my parents were so willing to give me and my two brothers an opportunity to play with the Mid-Missouri Tigers. In only my second year of hockey, and my last in central Missouri, my team won the State Championship and I was able to keeep the trophy for a week. It was a fantastic experience, and sadly, I was never able to recreate it for the rest of my hockey career. After moving, I played for the St. Peters Spirit (now just St. Peters Hockey Club) for three years, then join the Timberland High School varsity hockey club for three years. In my first two years with St. Peters, I played at the lowest level, and led my team in goals both years. While that was fun, I really wanted to play at a higher level, so in my last year there, I was able to jump up two levels. I scored seven goals early in the year, but at some point, I hit the beginning of a goal drought that felt like it would never end. I played for the Timberland Hockey B Team at the same time as this team, and after preseason, I don't recall scoring another goal for the rest of the year. I was really disappointed by this ending to my club hockey career. </p>

        <p>Moving on to Timberland Hockey was very interesting. In my sophomore year, I played on the B Team again, but I also played on the varsity team. I didn't score a goal all season, but somehow, I stuck around and my team made it to the final round of the Founders Cup tournam'ent (the Founders' Cup is the lowest of the three high school hockey tournaments). In the last game of the season, even though I went out there and helped prevent the opponent from scoring when they had two extra players on the ice, Eureka High School defeated us and won the tournament. This was the closest I ever came to winning another championship. At the end of the season, we still had to play one more game because we hadn't held a Senior Night game yet. Thankfully, an opponent stepped up and agreed to play us in an exhibition. The head coach was making sure everybody got ice time, and when he put me out onto the ice, I took advantage, scoring my first goal in over a year (although it didn't count because it wasn't during a season game). We won that chaotic game 8-7. </p>
        <p>In my junior year, I played for both the JV and Varsity teams (we didn't have a JV team in previous years). Nothing exciting happened this year, as we rarely won games and I never scored any goals until the last game of the season, in which my team dominated the whole game. I didn't even get an assist all year, and I was incredibly disappointed by this. I promised myself that, next year, I would be much better. Then when I senior year rolled around, I wasn't much better. I put up no points all year and, in the 18 games I played, didn't receive much ice time. I knew I was no longer getting better, and decided that I was done after the year was over. We nearly advanced to the second round of the Founders' Cup, despite only winning four games all year, and it may have been the saddest moment of my life. Hockey, for me, was over. I had to say goodbye to the sport I had played for nearly half my life up to this point, and looking back, I wish I could find a way to change things. </p>

        <h2>My Other Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I don't have many other interesting hobbies. I like playing baseball, although I quit a few years ago because it was too slow-paced and boring. I always will wonder where I would be if I had focused on that and stopped playing hockey sooner. Maybe I would have made it into something, but I think going into computer science would have been more beneficial to me overall, so I think this was the right choice. I also like playing video games, which are much more accessible than baseball because there are not many limits to what I can do with video games, and it's not always easy to find an open baseball field or people to play with to help improve your skills. Playing video games, I could have some fun anywhere and continue to improve upon certain skills within the games to become better, and it has conditioned me to do so in many other aspects of my life. I've recently found that I like playing word games, although only a few of them do the words themselves matter as much as the letters, so am I really learning much from them? Either way, I have just a few other hobbies and things I am interested in outside of the few things that have set my life on its current course. </p>
