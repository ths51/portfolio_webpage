    <center><p style="max-width: 600px; text-align: center; align-self: center;">I always love looking back at previous work I have done and seeing what I could have done batter at the time. And sometimes, I like showing off my work to other people and explaining how I created it. That's why I made this page: To show people what I have done and how it has impacted me throughout my experiences this year. It's been quite a year, to say the least. </p></center>

                </center>
                <p>These are some designs I created at Trophy Outlet that will be printed in full color on acrylic material and purchased by simple consumers. Several offer personalizable options for buyers, especially the baseball with the name and number on it.</p>

                </center>
                <p>Trophy Outlet decided that they wanted to add a Quick Ship section to their website for basic items that they could have ready to ship at any time, so I was tasked with creating an icon that would immediately be recognized as relating to Quick Ship items. These are my many attempts at creating the icon.</p>

                </center>
                <p>These designs were created for medals and small trophies that would be awarded for pickleball. We recognized that pickleball is one of the fastest-growing sports in the nation and decided to responds by creating some new designs to go on our medals and trophies. Our current ones are too basic and outdated, so I was trying to come up with more interesting ones using primarily elements from the old designs, seeing as that was all I really had access to. </p>

                </center>
                <p>An infographic I created to instruct people on how they can create their own customized LEGO Bricks with an image on them, because there had apparently been problems with people not understanding the process, which is built into Trophy Outlet's website. This page shows and describes only the first step, which is where the user will choose what type of LEGO Bricks they want.</p>

                </center>
                <p>These designs were created to go on medals and small trophies. They were made for dance and cheer (but mostly dance) awards, and it looks like I made a whole lot of them. Actually, as a part of the graphic design process, I tend to develop each idea and compare it to other ideas, and I tend to take an idea and run with it, so we'll likely only choose two or three of these many unique designs. </p>
