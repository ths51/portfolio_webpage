        <p>Today, I worked a lot on creating more of the base model of my web page and I added this blogpost box to test what it looks like and ensure that it does what it is supposed to do, looks good, and is clear and easy to read.</p>

        <p>It has been a long, busy last few weeks and I haven't taken much time to improve upon my passion project work so far, which is annoying and bothers me a lot. I have worked on it for a few minutes at a time, and unfortunately I have not been logging any of my work for those times because I was focused on making one change. So today, I took advantage of plenty of free time and decided to work on improving the website's compatibility with any type of device and screen, so that it will work on any device ranging from the smallest phone to the largest computer screen.</p><p>I made lots of adjustments to the styling document, altering certain details like the minimum and maximum width and height of any given box. I also learned how to use the calculation feature in CSS styling to make a box of varying size and fit it to its container. It was very intersting and it is something I see myself potentially using again if I was to make another website at any time. </p>

            <p>Since Trophy Outlet, my internship location, was closed today, I had to go to the classroom at Lewis & Clark Career Center instead and work on  my passion project. During my work, I created the portfolio page, where I will save photos of my work from my internship and other projects I want to share. I decided I wanted to split the page into two sides as a test of strength of sorts. Unfortunately, I ran into multiple problems with this idea because the sections were overlapping with each other, so I had to experiment with my code and figure out how to shrink the boxes and center them in their sections.</p><p>Eventually, after nearly 30 minutes of working on this piece of the project, I finally figured out a solution, although it is limited to two columns of boxes, so if I were to add another column, it might not work as expected. Here is a good look at what the web page looked like after all this experimenting with the code.</p><p>If the image loaded, you can see that the sections are fairly evenly divided and they stack on top of each other very well. It took plenty of work to perfect the look of this webpage and I think it looks great! During the rest of the day at Lewis & Clark, I worked on adding boxes and text elements to my webpage, and I made a lot of progress. </p>

        <p>After a long day of work at my internship at Trophy Outlet, I realized that I had plenty of time to spare and took the opportunity to work on this project again. It's been very busy recently and I finally got the time to fix an image issue I encountered last time I worked on the project. Since I have to access the image files from online for them to work on other devices, I had to figure out how to embed them into the web page directly and get them to properly resize into the boxes I need them to.</p><p>When I embedded them originally, the images were massive and overflowed out of the boxes way too much, but after adjusting the link I used to bring them into the page, the image, to my surprise, resized itself. When it still did not quite fit in the boxes properly though, I made some adjustments to the CSS styling that properly altered the size of the image to what I wanted it to be.</p>
        <p>I also made a few minor corrections and design choices to make the pages all look better and more clean because, as a graphic designer, I felt obligated to do so. I added a couple of new photos for some things I did this week, including a whole bunch of mylar designs for cheer, dance, and pickleball, because it gave me the opportunity to develop my process of making them and work on both coming up with new ideas and developing those ideas gradually so I can turn them into something that looks good. </p>

        <h2>Monday, April 10, 2023</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Throughout the day, I spent some time updating some pieces of the webpages and adding an entirely new page that discusses the adventures I've had while trying to go through the college selection process. I've spent time visiting a lot of colleges and working on applications for many of them, and I decided to log much of the journey because it has taken a lot of my time this past school year and has been an important part of my story. I added eight different universities I looked into and either visited, applied to, or both. I didn't put them in any specific order except for listing my final two choices at the bottom.</p><p>Eventually, when I actually make a decision, I will add an update at the bottom showing which school won out, but for now, I am down to two choices. I only had the time, though, to add descriptions to four of the eight universities. In each of the descriptions, I tried to discuss how each one entered my mind and hwo I heard of it, as well as my experiences on the campus or researching their computer science program, and my thoughts about each of the universities that impacted my decisions.</p><p>I also worked on adding each of the universities logos and getting them to properly format on the web page no matter how wide the window is. Everything on the screen has to adjust to the width of the screen as it gets larger or smaller because there are several elements that are placed side by side, which would not look good when the screen is not very wide. </p><p>Also, before I went to bed, I decided to transfer the universities' logos to Google Drive so they would more easily transfer to the web page when it was all said and done, since I would not have to access anything other than the other page links and the CSS stylesheet I created to hold all the web page formatting together. I also, in rather quick fashion, uploaded all the files for this project to GitHub, where I decided I would try to focus on working from now on. This is an important turning point in the project because I may have to adjust the way I work on it.</p><p>In only about 15 minutes, I figured out how to upload everything to GitHub and access it quickly and easily from there so I could edit the repository on the fly like I had with everything up to this point, and I am very happy with where I am at currently. At this point, I just kept going until I reached a point where GitHub was officially hosting the website on the internet. By 11 PM today, every web page was public and accessible through the domain to the home page: <a href="https://ths51.github.io/portfolio_webpage/home.html" style="font-family: 'Rubik'; margin: 0;">Home Page</a>!</p>

        <p>I did a lot of simple work on the whole website today. I made significant changes to the 'About Me' page and added a lot of detail on that page. I started the day with just a title and subtitle on the page, and ended up with multiple sections describing my personality and my story. I also improved some of the styling and formatting so the 'About Me' page, along with the other pages, looked good no matter what size the screen was, since everything has to adjust to small screens. I also added the descriptions and stories for a couple more of the universities I looked into, since I still needed to finish the second half of that page. I finished half of the remaining numbers and left the rest for laters, since I figured I would still have time to complete the rest. The last thing I did before the day was over was add this blogpost to update you on my progress for the day.</p><p>It's been very fun recently adding everything in and finalizing my work. I feel like I am getting close to a nearly fully-polished, fully-functional website that people can access and use on any device they want, even though I don't really expect people to use it. It's been a really fun experience and getting to reflect on it has been pretty cool as well. While much of the project looks just like text and paragraphs, I have put a lot of work into the behind-the-scenes stuff to make everything work flawlessly and make this website look good in every way I can. </p>

        <p>Once again, I did a lot of simple work on the site. I added an entire page for my experience with the CAPS Program so far, and added some details on it. I also made some fixes and improvements to pages I felt the need to. I was planning on adding descriptions for the last two universities I needed to, but I didn't quite find the time I needed to do so yet. Thankfully, as I am writing this, I still have a little bit of time later to make some adjustments and add some text. I will get there eventually. </p>

        <p>After polishing off some of the remaining stylization of the website, I am confident that I do not have much more work to do, and I think I would be fine showing off my work tomorrow if I needed to. I don't think the rest of what I need to do will take much time at all, and I am fairly certain that I will just be adding more to this page and the portfolio page. At this point, I have set it up so everything works almost flawlessly whenever it is implemented. There are only a few small issues, although a majority are impossible to notice or find. I love how this has turned out and I wonder how I can continue to explore this in the future. </p>

        <p>I made a couple of last-minute adjustments to the website itself and I believe I am ready to submit it. I am really happy with how it turned out, but there are a few more things I would like to learn how to do that I couldn't implement in this project. I was hoping to get them into the project, but I wasn't able to get them in time. I'm wondering if I'll be able to make some minor changes before the presentation, but I'm not concerned if I can't. </p>

        <p>While I had time over the weekend, I took the opportunity to add some more photos to each of the pages in the site, and also make some important changes to several parts that would make it look better and more attractive to the eye. I reformatted a couple of sections so they worked properly and looked good, since I had to do so to make the photos look good on the college selection page. </p><p>I also added a small section to the about me page with a few photos, and I separated the blogpage right here into smaller paragraphs so they looked better on mobile devices.</p>
