        <p>Today, I worked a lot on creating more of the base model of my web page and I added this blogpost box to test what it looks like and ensure that it does what it is supposed to do, looks good, and is clear and easy to read.</p>

        <p>It has been a long, busy last few weeks and I haven't taken much time to improve upon my passion project work so far, which is annoying and bothers me a lot. I have worked on it for a few minutes at a time, and unfortunately I have not been logging any of my work for those times because I was focused on making one change. So today, I took advantage of plenty of free time and decided to work on improving the website's compatibility with any type of device and screen, so that it will work on any device ranging from the smallest phone to the largest computer screen.</p><p>I made lots of adjustments to the styling document, altering certain details like the minimum and maximum width and height of any given box. I also learned how to use the calculation feature in CSS styling to make a box of varying size and fit it to its container. It was very intersting and it is something I see myself potentially using again if I was to make another website at any time. </p>

            <p>Since Trophy Outlet, my internship location, was closed today, I had to go to the classroom at Lewis & Clark Career Center instead and work on  my passion project. During my work, I created the portfolio page, where I will save photos of my work from my internship and other projects I want to share. I decided I wanted to split the page into two sides as a test of strength of sorts. Unfortunately, I ran into multiple problems with this idea because the sections were overlapping with each other, so I had to experiment with my code and figure out how to shrink the boxes and center them in their sections. Eventually, after nearly 30 minutes of working on this piece of the project, I finally figured out a solution, although it is limited to two columns of boxes, so if I were to add another column, it might not work as expected. Here is a good look at what the web page looked like after all this experimenting with the code. If the image loaded, you can see that the sections are fairly evenly divided and they stack on top of each other very well. It took plenty of work to perfect the look of this webpage and I think it looks great! During the rest of the day at Lewis & Clark, I worked on adding boxes and text elements to my webpage, and I made a lot of progress. </p>

        <p>After a long day of work at my internship at Trophy Outlet, I realized that I had plenty of time to spare and took the opportunity to work on this project again. It's been very busy recently and I finally got the time to fix an image issue I encountered last time I worked on the project. Since I have to access the image files from online for them to work on other devices, I had to figure out how to embed them into the web page directly and get them to properly resize into the boxes I need them to. When I embedded them originally, the images were massive and overflowed out of the boxes way too much, but after adjusting the link I used to bring them into the page, the image, to my surprise, resized itself. When it still did not quite fit in the boxes properly though, I made some adjustments to the CSS styling that properly altered the size of the image to what I wanted it to be.</p>
        <p>I also made a few minor corrections and design choices to make the pages all look better and more clean because, as a graphic designer, I felt obligated to do so. I added a couple of new photos for some things I did this week, including a whole bunch of mylar designs for cheer, dance, and pickleball, because it gave me the opportunity to develop my process of making them and work on both coming up with new ideas and developing those ideas gradually so I can turn them into something that looks good. </p>

        <h2>Monday, April 10, 2022</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Throughout the day, I spent some time updating some pieces of the webpages and adding an entirely new page that discusses the adventures I've had while trying to go through the college selection process. I've spent time visiting a lot of colleges and working on applications for many of them, and I decided to log much of the journey because it has taken a lot of my time this past school year and has been an important part of my story. I added eight different universities I looked into and either visited, applied to, or both. I didn't put them in any specific order except for listing my final two choices at the bottom. Eventually, when I actually make a decision, I will add an update at the bottom showing which school won out, but for now, I am down to two choices. I only had the time, though, to add descriptions to four of the eight universities. In each of the descriptions, I tried to discuss how each one entered my mind and hwo I heard of it, as well as my experiences on the campus or researching their computer science program, and my thoughts about each of the universities that impacted my decisions. I also worked on adding each of the universities logos and getting them to properly format on the web page no matter how wide the window is. Everything on the screen has to adjust to the width of the screen as it gets larger or smaller because there are several elements that are placed side by side, which would not look good when the screen is not very wide. </p><p>Also, before I went to bed, I decided to transfer the universities' logos to Google Drive so they would more easily transfer to the web page when it was all said and done, since I would not have to access anything other than the other page links and the CSS stylesheet I created to hold all the web page formatting together. I also, in rather quick fashion, uploaded all the files for this project to GitHub, where I decided I would try to focus on working from now on. This is an important turning point in the project because I may have to adjust the way I work on it. In only about 15 minutes, I figured out how to upload everything to GitHub and access it quickly and easily from there so I could edit the repository on the fly like I had with everything up to this point, and I am very happy with where I am at currently. At this point, I just kept going until I reached a point where GitHub was officially hosting the website on the internet. By 11 PM today, every web page was public and accessible through the domain to the home page: <a href="https://ths51.github.io/portfolio_webpage/home.html">https://ths51.github.io/portfolio_webpage/home.html</a></p>
