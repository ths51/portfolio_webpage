# portfolio_webpage

This entire repository is primarily for a passion project of mine where I created a website entirely from HTML and CSS that I wrote on my own, although I used internet resources to come up with solutions to some of the problems I encountered along the way. There is no JavaScript at all, nor is there any seriously complicated HTML, although there is some interesting CSS involved.
