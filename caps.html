        <h2>My CAPS Experience</h2>
        <p>As an associate in the CAPS program, I got to meet and talk with several professionals within the technology sector. I've had a wonderful time meeting people like cybersecurity expert Aaron Gomez, who came to our class in the middle of the first semester to help us learn how we could give ourselves an advantage to go into the field of cybersecurity if we are interested. He showed us several resources he used to get into his current position and advised us to use them if we were interested, and he showed us many of the possible certifications we could get that would help us in cybersecurity, since it is a very diversified and specialized field, and there a lot of different cybersecurity subjects each of the certifications focuses on. That may be been the most interesting and informative guest speaker we had during first semester. </p>
