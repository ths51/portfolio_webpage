        <h2>My CAPS Experience</h2>
        <p>As an associate in the CAPS program, I got to meet and talk with several professionals within the technology sector. I've had a wonderful time meeting people like cybersecurity expert Aaron Gomez, who came to our class in the middle of the first semester to help us learn how we could give ourselves an advantage to go into the field of cybersecurity if we are interested. He showed us several resources he used to get into his current position and advised us to use them if we were interested, and he showed us many of the possible certifications we could get that would help us in cybersecurity, since it is a very diversified and specialized field, and there a lot of different cybersecurity subjects each of the certifications focuses on. That may be been the most interesting and informative guest speaker we had during first semester. </p>
        <p>We also went on site visits to locations such as Didion Orf Recycling and Charter-Spectrum in Maryland Heights. At Didion Orf, we learned about the recycling process, how they manage the products they receive, how they repair and refurbish many of them, and how they turn that into their own profit by selling fixed up products. That was a very interesting visit, but when we went to Charter-Spectrum, I found that more interesting because we got to talk with several mid-to-high-ranking employees that described what they do there for work. We met someone that dealt with cybersecurity, one working in UI/UX Design, and they talked to us about a variety of topics over our two-day visit there. The site visits were a major part of the experience and I had a lot of fun on them. </p>

        <h2>My Internship Experience</h2>
        <p>Since mid-January, I have been an intern at Trophy Outlet in Wentzville, Missouri. As the name says, they sell trophies and awards for people that want or need them, but they also do a whole lot of other things. They specialize in engravings and they often use this in fundraisers, which they have helped many organizations with. I have primarily been working on creating new graphic designs for several different products, including prints that will go on medals and acrylic awards. I also have created several that will soon be implemented on their website. </p>
        <p>They also print images on LEGO brick puzzles, which can be a fantastic gift for someone that likes LEGOs and any friends or family. It's very cool and they have created a whole other brand for it called BrickYourPic, which is the website I designed some new graphics for. Soon, I will also be involved in posting new products, including the ones I have designed, on their website(s). </p>
        <p>This has been a very fun experience for me so far, and I have also gained lots of experience creating graphic designs for different puproses than I previously have. It's been very interesting seeing what I can do and getting the opportunity to think in a variety of different ways. I'm hoping to get a chance to work as an intern there this summer. </p>
